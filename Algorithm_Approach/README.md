# Algorithmic Approach for Lung Cancer Detection using Traditional and GAN-based Data Augmentation

---

## Step 1: Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing

**Dataset Source:**  
Obtain CT scan images from the publicly available LIDC dataset (Lung Image Database Consortium).

**Image Preprocessing:**  
- Resize CT scans to standard dimensions `(224 × 224 pixels)`.
- Normalize images to the range `[0, 1]`.
- Label images clearly:
  - `1`: Malignant nodules  
  - `0`: Benign nodules or no nodules

## Step 2: Splitting the Dataset

Split the dataset into two subsets to ensure unbiased evaluation:

| Subset          | Percentage (%) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Training Set    | 85%            |
| Testing Set     | 15%            |

## Step 3: Data Augmentation Techniques

### A. Traditional Data Augmentation

Augmentation performed dynamically using Keras `ImageDataGenerator`:

- Random rotations (±20 degrees)
- Horizontal and vertical flipping
- Random zooming (±15%)

**Pseudocode for Traditional Augmentation:**
```pseudo
For each image in the training dataset:
    Apply random rotation within ±20°
    Apply random horizontal or vertical flip
    Apply random zoom within ±15%
    Yield augmented images for training batch
```

### B. GAN-based Data Augmentation

GAN technique employed: **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**  
Purpose: To synthesize realistic lung nodule images, enhancing dataset diversity.

**GAN Training Steps:**

- Define GAN architecture:
  - **Generator:** Deep convolutional network generating images from random noise vectors.
  - **Discriminator:** CNN classifier distinguishing real from synthetic images.

**Pseudocode for GAN Augmentation:**
```pseudo
Step 1: Initialize GAN (Generator & Discriminator)

Step 2: GAN Training loop (epochs: 100-200)
For each epoch:
    Train discriminator on real images (label=1)
    Generate fake images from generator, train discriminator (label=0)
    Update generator based on discriminator feedback
    Monitor GAN quality regularly

Step 3: Post GAN Training
    Generate synthetic lung nodule images using trained Generator
    Integrate synthetic images into original training dataset
```

## Step 4: Deep Learning Model Training

Use transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet50:

- Replace the original final layer with a dense sigmoid layer (binary classification).
- Fine-tune model with low learning rate to prevent overfitting.

**Pseudocode for Training:**
```pseudo
Load ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet
Replace final layer → Dense (activation=sigmoid)

For each augmentation method (Traditional, GAN-based):
    Train model for 20 epochs
    Validate periodically on test set
    Record performance metrics for comparison
```

---

## Step 5: Model Evaluation

Evaluate both trained models (Traditional vs GAN) on the test set:

Metrics considered:

- **Accuracy**
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**
- **Specificity**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC**

---

## Step 6: Comparative Analysis

Conduct a thorough comparison between models trained using Traditional and GAN-based augmentations:

- Statistical analysis of performance metrics
- Visual comparisons:
  - ROC curves
  - Confusion matrices
- Discuss effectiveness and advantages of each augmentation method clearly.

---

## Step 7: Documentation and Reporting

Prepare comprehensive documentation covering:

- Experimental procedures and setup
- Results with visualizations
- Discussion on strengths and limitations of augmentation methods
- Clearly stated conclusions based on comparative analysis
